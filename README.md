Hello World! 

My name is Huiyu (Charlotte) Deng. I am a data scientist at City of Hope National Medical Center. I just received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Southern California. Since I am done with my dissertation, I have more time to manage my GitHub page (YAY). Three main things that are important in my repo (I'm not saying the others are *trash* LOL): 

* Implement the Shapelet algorithm in R (Shapelet)
* Binary random effects expectation maximizaiton tree (BREEMtree)
* Visualization of the cases of coronavirus in LA (stopped updating in May 2020 because I was so sad about the spike of cases after the lockdown)

I am currently learning about implementing ML models in Python. Saying goodbye to R is not easy for me :(
